"The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nThe Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nTherefore let there always be non-being,\n  so we may see their subtlety,\nAnd let there always be being,\n  so we may see their outcome.\nThe two are the same,\nBut after they are produced,\n  they have different names."
